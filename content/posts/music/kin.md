> On the 15th of May 2018, we received a call which would change our lives forever.

After a successful tour, the band *Awaken I Am* was struck by a terrible
tragedy: their guitarist, Connor, was hit by a car and had died at the scene.
The crash was not an "accident"; the driver of the oncoming car had been
purposfully driving on the wrong side of the road in a suicide attempt.

*Kin* expresses the bands frustration and anger at the other party, asking them
if the event "keeps [them] up," and wishing them "no peace." The entire album,
*The Beauty In Tragedy*, was described as a catharic experience for the band,
giving them a chance to be "sad, angry, [and] confused," and helping them "find
a way to come to terms with the grief the best way we can through music."

*Kin*'s intense drums and guitar contrast with the poignant
meaning behind the song, expressing the variegated emotions that come with such
a loss. The band expresses anger at the other party and laments the loss of
someone with whom they were "a family." To me, the intensity of emotion makes
this song that much more engaging. The songs heavy bass and meloncholy synth fills scream of loss, and the motif of broken glass and broken families in the music video beg people to consider the impact of their actions on other people, not just themselves.

Despite the intense backstory of the song, it's also a song that you can casually
listen to. It's heavy and exciting, yet still emotionally presentâ€”perfect for a
making a short car ride a little more fun. Although I couldn't find the song on
a band website, it's available on streaming platforms like Youtube and Spotify.
Go have a listen!
