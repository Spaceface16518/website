Hopefully you're here from the scavenger hunt.

You've made it to the final link. This is my website*. It's a fun little place where I put my thoughts and work. You can use it to [read about me](/about), or read some of [my blog posts](/posts).

Once you're done, you can drop into a [video call with me](https://meet.jit.si/ellas-scavenger-hunt). The only thing you'll need is a device that has a camera and microphone. A computer might work better, but if you're using your phone for this, it's totally fine.

**This isn't actually my website, it's a edited version made just for you! You can visit [my actual website](https://amritrathie.now.sh), but it's basically the same thing (except it doesn't have this page).*
